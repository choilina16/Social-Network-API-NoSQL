## Objective 
Build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list by using the following:
- Express.js for routing
- A MongoDB database
- The Mongoose ODM
- Create your own seed data after you've created your API
- Create a walkthrough video
* optional: JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps

## Acceptance Criteria

```md

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

```
